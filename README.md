# MT Exercise 2: Pytorch RNN Language Models

This repo shows how to train neural language models using [Pytorch example code](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model). Thanks to Emma van den Bold, the original author of these scripts. 

# Requirements

- This only works on a Unix-like system, with bash.
- Python 3 must be installed on your system, i.e. the command `python3` must be available
- Make sure virtualenv is installed on your system. To install, e.g.

    `pip install virtualenv`

# Steps

Clone this repository in the desired place:

    git clone https://github.com/marcamsler1/mt-exercise-02
    cd mt-exercise-02

Create a new virtualenv that uses Python 3. Please make sure to run this command outside of any virtual Python environment:

    ./scripts/make_virtualenv.sh

**Important**: Then activate the env by executing the `source` command that is output by the shell script above.

Download and install required software:

    ./scripts/install_packages.sh

Download and preprocess data:

    ./scripts/download_data.sh

Note:
We made a small modification to download_data.sh because the wget command didn't work on our system (Windows with Git Bash).
Instead of wget, we used curl to download the dataset.  

Train a model:

    ./scripts/train.sh

The training process can be interrupted at any time, and the best checkpoint will always be saved.

Generate (sample) some text from a trained model with:

    ./scripts/generate.sh

To plot the log files, run:

    python scripts/plot_data.py logs/*.txt

Additional information:

    We misunderstood the part of the exercise to create tables for each of the perplexities and instead created a "table" for each of the different dropout rates. The plots are still created correctly, but the process to create the plots is     different from the instructions in the assignment.
